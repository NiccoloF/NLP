      "Went the other night with my family. Glad we tried it but will not go back. Server was nice, bread was awful and the food was nothing to write home about. I had the shrimp fradiavolo, nothing special, small shrimp floating in sauce with, over cooked pasta. My daughter had the pizza, pizza dough was terrible and raw like the stale bread they gave us. My wife had the puttanesca and they actually put olives with the pitts ...LOLOL! i guess they can't afford pitted Kalamata. Do they not warn people of this so they do not chip a tooth. I hear the owner is from Westchester NY. WOW is he fooling the people in Henderson. I asked the waitress why the Faux pizza brick oven in the front was not on and she said it was too hot! LOL. You would think they would have thought that out before investing in a oven of that caliber. Personally it looks like this may have been place that was owned by someone before that was smart and got out. The ownner now is clueless about Italian food and service and is trying to fool the people into believing it is authentic when it is really just...cheap food done wrong.  If you are going to try and sell a authentic premise...have authentic food. I will be surprised if they last much longer with whoever is cooking in the back. Its too bad because the place is cute, cozy with potential.\n",

The steamed broccoli was so-so, and the free wine with the dish was okay.  \\n\\nOverall, I would say this place is for more tourists and medium sized parties.\n",

      "Good neighborhood restaurants are hard to find, a place that you can call your own, where the food is good and reasonably priced.  And in the southwest it's even harder to find a good neighborhood restaurant that serves Italian food.  In today's world of fast food and chain restaurants, people tend to choose the Olive Garden over a small business when the craving for good pasta and/or pizza dishes.  Carmen's Bistro on Baseline in Tempe lets one go back for a nice Italian meal without the hassle of corporate America's set menu.  A small place that mixes neighborhood bar with neighborhood restaurant, Carmen's is perfect for a night with friends or even a quiet setting to bring a date for the first time.  As you walk up, the kitchen if fully exposed so that one can watch the cooks prepare tasty delights that come out of the kitchen.\\n Upon arriving with a group of friends from out of town for an early afternoon dinner, we took a seat in the corner of the dimly lit restaurant.  The menu is traditional American Italian cuisine, serving everything from anti pasta to spaghetti with marinara to pizza.  Everyone in the group had the same thought as we looked at the menu, and a round or calzones was ordered by all, with two people getting fried zucchini sticks and a salad to start.  Arrival of the first course was quick, though the person that ordered the fried zucchini was surprised to see that the zucchini he ordered magically turned into fried mozzarella sticks.  Instead of sending it back, he ate them with much delight.  A small mistake turned into a lovely appetizer that was served with marina sauce for dipping.  The salad that came out was simple, your basic garden salad, that was portioned for a quick bite before the main course, not to filling.\\n The calzones then came out a little later.  Wait time was about twenty minutes, acceptable considering that they are made fresh in the kitchen.  The crust on the calzone was very basic, and not seasoned all that much.  A little garlic power would've gone a long way.  The same marinara sauce that was served with the mozzarella sticks came with it, for the same dipping purposes.  The sauce it self was a little sweet to taste, and served cold.  Heat would've made it a little more enjoyable, and of course a little garlic might take away the extra sweetness that was brought on by the tomato.  The filling in the calzone was hot, but not too hot to where one might burn their mouth.  The mixture that was in the calzone was your basic pizza toppings and could've been seasoned with Italian herbs for extra flavor, a little disappointing to say the least.\\n A very filling meal for everyone in the group, though not as satisfying for one's taste buds.  Service was not bad, but the screw up with the appetizer might be more a reflection of a lack of attention to detail by our server and not the cook.  Carmen's Bistro has a nice foundation in place, but still has some work to do if it wants to be considered a fine Italian food at a decent rate.  Still, it was better than the corporate menu and over trained service at the Olive Garden, making it a nice place to walk up to and eat, but not a place to set your plans to for an evening.\n",

Place your order as you walk in, receive a number, get your drink yourself, and wait...\\n\\nFood is considerably better than anything fast food Italian, but it is still priced in the same league as nearby Italian chains such as Tagliani, Olive Garden, and Macaroni Grill.  I suppose it is nice to pay $10 for a simple pasta that is served rather fast, but if it's fast food then shouldn't it be priced a little lower?\\n\\nPizza is very good.  Alfredo sauce is very, very runny.  Garlic bread that accompanies the entrees are quite good.\n",

Better to have high standards than none!\\n\\nHonestly- this place is way over priced and the food not so good. Only good thing going was the decor and the ambiance.\\n\\nHere's the breakdown:\\n1. Food way over priced. Yes, you get salad or soup, garlic bread and free red & white wine. But when you're paying min. $21, the main entree better taste good. And it didn't. Granted the portions are HUGE but still not worth if if the food is bad.\\n2. I ordered the linguini seafood- the seafood part was good but the sauce was bland and tasted too much like tomato paste. The pasta itself was way too al dente. \\n3. My sister ordered the cheese ravioli- the sauce was also way too bland and there was too much sauce on the dish. \\n4. For dessert, we sampled the cheesecake- tasted like a frozen cheesecake from a local grocery store. \\n5. The \\\"cappucino\\\" is really not cappucino. It's more like hot chocolate. Also, as an Italian restaurant, the owners should know better- in Italy, cappucino is a breakfast drink. In the evenings, one drinks espresso with or without liquor in it. \\n6. Nothing special about the salad or the wines. I can definintely say I have had better wines.\\n7.

The only thing I liked, honestly, was the bread and the wine. \\n\\nWe had the prosciutto fresh mozzarella dish and it was greasy, bland, salty and just bad. Our main dishes were the spaghetti carbonara, and it was such an Americanized \\\"past with alfredo sauce\\\" version of it. Very cheesey and creamy and way overpowering smoked pancetta. It was truly awful.  And at $16 or $18 a plate, hardly worth it and far from what traditional pasta carbonara should be. I'm not sure why restaurants use a cheesy alfredo sauce for carbonara, when it should be egg used for the consistency, not gobs of cheesy sauce. Bleh!\\n\\nThe atmosphere, wine and bread were good, but I can get that at home. Was sorely disappointed and felt the regret of spending $80 on a totally mediocre to bad experience with the food.\\n\\nI have yet to find good Italian food in the Phoenix area.

      "This is a decent spot for some casual dining in the Grand Canl Shoppes in the Venetian. A few years ago this place used to be called Enoteca San Marco and I could honestly say that it boasted the best pizza I've ever had. Unfortunately ownership has since changed and although the menu looks almost identical to its earlier version, the quality has dropped a great deal. As things stand now, Enoteca has 2 things going for it: a good location in the middle of the replica of St. Mark's square which means that you will get a chance to see a performance of the \\\"Phantom\\\" soundtrack and some Italian opera pieces during dinner and that you won't pay an arm and a leg for a meal. The pizzas are about $18-21 each and are sufficient to keep you satiated and  one can easily feed 2 diners if you add an appetizer or 2. I would say the Prosciutto and Goat Cheese pizza is the best, although the last time I ordered it the pizza came out burnt and overloaded with cheese. Do yourself a favor and don't order the Pesto Pizza; it is supremely disappointing. Finally the wine list is (as expected) dominated by Italian vintages but the staff does not offer much in the way of suggestions if you're having trouble deciding. Their pours of wine are also stingy and the waiter made the mistake of using a wide rimmed glass for champagne. If you're not in the mood for pizza, the restaurant offers a limited selection of meats and pasta which are rather standard Italian fare and which you can get for approximately the same price and superior preparation in the nearby Canaletto and Postrio.\n",

The tiramisu and canolli were huge.  Over the top huge.  Very much made to be shared.\\n\\nOverall, we were very pleasantly impressed.\n",

      "Without a reservation, we walked in. We were seated promptly. Our table overlooked the open kitchen, the front of the house and the main room. It was the perfect booth. We were waited on by a team, headed by two waiters (a man and a woman) who were superb, and experienced. They brought us drinks, explained the menu, and got us started on oysters. I went with the Insalata di Cesare, with grilled lettuce, and a fabulous dressing, and for a main course the Pici Toscani, with Bolognese sauce. The salad was noticeable because it is the first variation on Cesare I have seen in a long time that really worked. The grilled lettuce and the stronger mustard, anchovy flavor was a hit. As to the Pici Toscana, the noodles were larger than spaghetti and hand rolled, with the pasta dressed in olive oil and served over the Bolognese. This dish was as good as it gets. It got me thinking how I could do that at home, if at all. Knockout status. My wife had the pre-theatre package, and she loved it. Desserts were a delight, with the Tiramisu, and the Panna Cotta both showing serious pastry chef attention to detail and flavor. I finished up with a coffee house worthy cappuccino. We loved every minute at Circo. We were especially pleased with the fantastic waitstaff, who displayed great knowledge, and attention to detail that is worthy of  5 stars. And, they made it look so easy. As we walked out, I saw the place was jammed and jumping. I am surprised the Ma\\u00eetre d' squeezed us in. Thanks. We'll be back.\n",
